              Welcome to my website, my name is{" "}

              With over a decade of being a Transactional Lawyer, Investment,
              Business Strategist and Corporate Trainer. I help business interns
              and executives acquire short-term and long-term training to refine

              <span className="text-rawSienna font-bold">Early days-</span>
              <br /> Born on the 22nd day of March, I had my first real exposure
              in Nigeriaâ€™s foremost single sex school for girls, Queens College,
              Lagos, where I learned that real pursuit in life is akin to
              passion and realistic goals. I grew up as the only girl child in
              the family.
            </p>
            <p>
              <span className="text-rawSienna font-bold">Career-</span>
              <br />I am a Lawyer & Business Expert exploring extreme areas of
              the law and business and have sat over many arbitration matters as
              an Arbitration Specialist. As a commercial law expert, I have
              gained prominence in the corporate ladder and I'm currently on a
              mission to support dwindling economies thrive through delivering
              sessions on Capital Projects and Capital project funds management
              within Africa.

            <p>
              When I am not assisting small, medium enterprises known as the
              SMEs with Roadmaps to navigate through their business strategies
              and practicability, I engage assiduously with civil society,
              non-profit organizations, and religious institutions through
              volunteering as a way of creating lasting change across the globe
              bearing in mind the essence of community development.

              <br />A Graduate of the Faculty of Law Ambrose Alli University,
              Edo State where I bagged my LL.B degree with a second class upper
              division sparking up intuitive calculations about how someone so
              daring can combine tough leadership roles and academics in a
              single stroke. After my call to the Nigerian Bar as a Barrister of
              the Supreme Court of Nigeria and an LLM degree in Commercial Law
              from Ahmadu Bello University, Kaduna State, my professional
              journey has been far from lopsided as I have berthed through areas
              in the legal profession that are gradually taking toll. Currently,
              I am an MBA student of the Prestigious Coventry University in
              England.
